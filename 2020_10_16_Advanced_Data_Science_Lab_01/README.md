## Activity B
<b>Question:</b>
You are expected to write a python code for counting words in a string i.e., count how many times a word appears in a string.  
Your final code must fulfil the following requirements:
<ul>
<li>You code should accept user input as a string</li>
<li>Use dictionary data structure to hold words and their respective counts</li>
<li>Special characters must be removed from words before adding them to the dictionary data structure</li>
<li>Numeric values must be counted as single entry in the dictionary regardless of their values. For example in “I have £35 to spend on 5 different items” your code should count numeric values as “2” this is because two numeric values has appeared in the string.</li>
<li>You code must not differentiate between uppercase, lowercase and init-cap words i.e., “UNIVERSITY”, “university” and “University” must be considered same.</li>
</ul>

<b>Example String:</b>
<p>I have £35 to spend on 5 different items</p>
<center><b>OR</b></center>
<p>Hello there! My name is Prithvi Soma, and i am the owner of Perplexeus Laboratories! Its been running for 2 years now and has been delivering some spectacular results as of now, like the combustible lemons or the personality cores which in conjunction can burn your house down, so, word of advise, don't let them close to each other. Trust me you don't want it.<p>

## Activity C
<b>Question:</b>
Building on Activity B, rather than taking “user input”, you can read data from Wikipedia i.e. Web Scraping. Once you have dumped the data, perform the following:
<ul>
<li>Count how many times a word appears by ignoring stop words such as “the”, “a”, “an”, “in”</li>
<li>Identify the total number of hyperlinks in the dumped data.</li>
<li>List all references in the dumped data</li>
</ul>
<b>NOTE:</b> this task is intended only for these who are relatively proficient in python.
